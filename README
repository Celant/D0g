# D0g

A discord bot written in Go for City17.

## Setup

To setup the bot, you need first create an application via the discord dev area
here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

You can safely ignore virtually everything it says, just give it a name and
then click create. After that, you'll have a "Create a Bot User" button for
you app, click it to get the actual bot user.

Now you have a bot user, you can get the token for the bot. You'll need this
for the bot config file. You'll also see a client ID, you'l want this too for
the next step.

The final step to add the bot to your server is to go to the following url,
with YOUR_CLIENT_ID substituted for the client ID of your bot: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=0

That will give you the option to select a server you own to join the bot to.
